Spruce up your sidebar with this WYSIWYG widget. You can add colors, links, and even images to your sidebar without knowing code.

== Description ==

Spruce up your sidebar with this WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) widget. We’ve taken the fancy editor you know and love from the "Write Post" screen and added it to the text widget. This means you can add colors, links, and even images to your sidebar without knowing code.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and unzip it on your computer
2. Upload the file wysiwyg-text-widget.php to your WordPress plugin directory, optionally putting it in the widgets folder (if you have one)
3. Go to the "Plugins" tab in your WordPress admin panel and look through the list for "WYSIWYG Text Widget" (it’s usually near the bottom)
4. Activate the "WYSIWYG Text Widget"
5. Go to the "Presentation" tab and the "Widgets" sub-tab; if all went well, you now have a "WYSIWYG Text 1" widget
6. Use the widget or create more at the bottom of the "Widgets" screen as you like
